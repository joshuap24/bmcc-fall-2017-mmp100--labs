## Lists

1. Create a valid, W3-compliant HTML document called `lists.html`.
2. Organize the following data into nested lists:
```
HTML
Images
Links
Color
Names
Hex
RGB
RGBA
HSL
```

## Images

1. Create a valid, W3-compliant HTML document called `images.html`.
2. Visit [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com) and choose two images of squirrels that are licensed under a Creative Commons License.
3. Include the two images in your `images.html` document using the `https` scheme. **Do not download the files.**

## Links
Make links of the images in the previous step so that clicking on either picture takes the user to the Flickr page for the image.

## Colors

1. Create a valid, W3-compliant HTML document called `colors.html`.
2. Create three `div`s or `sections`: one for lists, one for images, and one for links. Using the content you created for **Lists**, **Images**, and **Links**, above, give each container a background color, including the `body` element.
